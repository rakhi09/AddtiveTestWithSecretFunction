**Problem Statement Snippet:**  
You are given a function 'secret()' that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. In your favorite programming language, write a command-line program that takes one command-line argument (a number) and determines if the secret() function is additive [secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y)], for all combinations x and y, where x and y are all prime numbers less than the number passed via the command-line argument  

**Assumptions:**  
For the purpose of the execution of our IsAdditive method, we have made the following assumptions  
1) Input will be Integer value  
2) Secret() method returns the output value same as the input value  

**Examples:**  
1) Input: a  
Output: Not a valid number, input must be numeric  
2) Input: -1  
Output: Number is not additive  
3) Input: 1  
Output: Number is not additive 
4) Input: 2  
Output: Number is additive  
5) Input: 5  
Output: Number is additive
